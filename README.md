We're working on building a system to identify Banglish slang, a blend of Bengali and English, in digital text. Our goal is to improve understanding and communication in online platforms where Banglish is prevalent.

This project is ongoing, and we're actively developing and refining our detection algorithms. Stay tuned for updates as we progress towards our goal of creating a reliable Banglish slang detection tool!
